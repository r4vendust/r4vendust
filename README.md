    Here you won't find much but i hope that what you find may be useful to you and that some repository 
    can become an inspiration for someone and that in time, one of the repositories can serve as an example or framework for a project

  <h2>🤰 A BIT ABOUT ME</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> I develop just about anything that i think is fun</li>
    <li>The language i most like to use is C++. Do i think it's fun? No, but i think is fun to lose my mind <s>everyday</s> once in a while.</li>
  </ul>
  When i was a kid/teenager i had a couple of game servers that i put together myself, <b>OTS (open tibia server)</b> <b>MuOnline</b>, <b>Perfect World</b>, you name it.
  And the one that i most liked and worked, Tibia, got about 334 simultaneously players online in just one month.

  <fragment>So without much further a do here are some of the languages i've used on my lifetime. Ready?</fragment>
<h2>Languages that i learned or messed with (more importants first)</h2>
