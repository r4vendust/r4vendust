  <p>
    Here you won't find much but i hope that what you find may be useful to you and that some repository 
    can become an inspiration for someone and that in time, one of the repositories can serve as an example or framework for a project

  <h2>A BIT ABOUT ME</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> I develop just about anything that i think is fun</li>
    <li>The language i most like to use is C++. Do i think it's fun? No, but i think is fun to lose my mind <s>everyday</s> once in a while.</li>
  </ul>
  When i was a kid/teenager i had a couple of game servers that i put together myself, OTS (open tibia server) MuOnline, Perfect World, you name it.

  <fragment>So without much further a do here are some of the languages i've used on my lifetime. Ready to get tired?</fragment>

<ul>
  <li>Pascal</li>
  <li>Visual Basic 6</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>C++</li>
  <li>SQL</li>
</ul>
There is more but sorry, i got tired 😫

Perhaps there'll be more here but i'm hungry! いただきます (itadakimasu!) 🍜
